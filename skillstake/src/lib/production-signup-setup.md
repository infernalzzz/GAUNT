# Production Sign-Up Setup for SkillStake

## 1. Disable Email Confirmation (Required)

### Supabase Dashboard Method:
1. Go to **Authentication → Settings**
2. Find **"Email Auth"** section
3. **Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"**
4. **Save changes**

### Verify Settings:
- Users should be able to sign up and immediately log in
- No email verification required
- Account creation is instant

## 2. Test the Complete Flow

### Sign-Up Process:
1. User clicks "Sign Up Free"
2. Fills out username, email, password
3. Username availability is checked in real-time
4. Account is created immediately
5. User can log in right away

### Login Process:
1. User enters username and password
2. System looks up email from username
3. Authenticates with Supabase
4. User is logged in

## 3. Security Considerations

### What We're Trading Off:
- ✅ **Instant sign-up** (better UX)
- ❌ **Email verification** (less security)

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Username uniqueness** prevents duplicate accounts
- **Password requirements** (minimum 6 characters)
- **RLS policies** protect user data
- **Supabase auth** handles security

## 4. Production Recommendations

### For Launch:
- Keep email confirmation **disabled** for better UX
- Monitor for spam/abuse accounts
- Consider adding **rate limiting** if needed

### For Future:
- Could add **email verification** as optional
- Could add **phone verification** for high-stakes lobbies
- Could add **admin approval** for large amounts
