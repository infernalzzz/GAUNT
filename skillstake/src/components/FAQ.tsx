      question: "Is this gambling?",
      answer: "GUANT.GG is a skill-based competition platform. To play, you must sign up and verify your account. Matches are created and played outside the website in custom game lobbies. GUANT.GG manages booking, check-in, and payouts."
    },
    {
      question: "How do payouts work?",
      answer: "The winner receives the total pot minus a 10% platform fee. Bonds manage no-shows: each player puts up a bond (½ of platform fee ÷ players). If someone no-shows, their bond is forfeited — $1 max goes to platform admin fee, the rest credits the attending player. Both buy-ins are refunded on no-shows."
    },
    {
      question: "What about streaming?",
      answer: "Streaming (with delay) is planned for future phases to prevent ghosting and cheating. Phase 1 focuses on core lobby discovery and match mechanics."
    },
    {
      question: "Which regions are supported?",
      answer: "We're piloting in OCE (Oceania) first. More regions including NA, EU, and SEA are coming soon based on community demand."
    },
    {
      question: "How does check-in work?",
      answer: "For \"Play Now\" lobbies, a 10-minute check-in window opens immediately when both players join. For scheduled matches, check-in opens 10 minutes before the slot and closes 10 minutes after. Both players must check in to receive the match code. The actual match is played in a custom lobby within your game client."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data safe?",
      answer: "Yes. We use Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data. All sensitive operations require authentication, and we follow industry-standard security practices."
